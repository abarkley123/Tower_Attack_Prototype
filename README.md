# Tower Defense Prototype

This is a web-based Tower defense game written in JavaScript, with some additions of ThreeJs, JQuery, and a few other useful libraries. The game turns the traditional aspect of a tower-defense game on its head, allowing the player control over the entities being spawned, where the goal is simply to get your units to the end point.


## Getting Started

Since this game is purely web-based, that means getting started is simple. Clone/fork/download the code and you can simply open the sketch.js file in your browser. Alternatively, you may bind sketch.js to the landing page of a local webserver, specifiying a port to use e.g http://localhost:8080.

### Prerequisites

Some basic of Tower Defense games would be useful in knowing the typical formulaic pattern of thesse games - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense. This game takes the opposite perspective in terms of gameplay, although the progression mechanics for the most part essentially remain the same.
