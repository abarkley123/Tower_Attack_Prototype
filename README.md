# Tower Defense Prototype

This is a web-based Tower defense game written in JavaScript, with some additions of ThreeJs, JQuery, and a few other useful libraries. The game turns the traditional aspect of a tower-defense game on its head, allowing the player control over the entities being spawned, where the goal is simply to get your units to the end poing.
